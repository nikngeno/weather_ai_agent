Knowing that might help me provide more targeted information.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, absolutely! Drug discovery is one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas for AI in healthcare. The pace of innovation here is staggering. Here are some of the key new developments and trends:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **Designing \"From Scratch\":** Instead of just screening existing compounds, generative AI models are now being used to *design entirely new molecules* with specific desired properties (e.g., binding affinity to a target, improved solubility, reduced toxicity).\n*   **\"De Novo\" Drug Design:** This is a major leap. AI is exploring vast chemical spaces that humans might never have conceived of. Examples include using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to create novel chemical structures.\n*   **Target-Specific Design:** AI can be trained to generate molecules that are highly specific to a particular protein target implicated in a disease.\n\n**2. Enhanced Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **\"Omics\" Data Integration:** AI excels at integrating and analyzing massive datasets from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics to identify novel biological targets that are crucial for disease pathways.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models are being developed to predict whether a newly identified biological target is \"druggable\" – meaning, can a molecule be designed to effectively interact with it.\n\n**3. Accelerating Pre-Clinical Testing and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Predicting ADMET Properties:** AI is getting much better at predicting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug candidates early in the discovery process. This helps researchers weed out compounds likely to fail later, saving time and money.\n*   **Predicting Efficacy:** AI can analyze preclinical data to better predict the likelihood of a drug candidate being effective in living organisms.\n*   **Optimizing Lead Compounds:** Once a promising compound is found, AI can help modify its structure to improve its potency, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile.\n\n**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Identifying New Uses:** AI can scan vast databases of existing drugs, patient data, and scientific literature to identify drugs approved for one condition that might be effective against another. This is a faster and often cheaper route to new treatments.\n*   **Network-Based Approaches:** AI can analyze complex biological networks to find drugs that can modulate specific pathways relevant to a new disease.\n\n**5. Revolutionizing Clinical Trial Design and Patient Selection:**\n\n*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can identify biomarkers that predict which patients are most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more efficient and successful clinical trials.\n*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** AI is being explored to predict the likelihood of success for a given clinical trial based on various factors.\n*   **Optimizing Trial Logistics:** AI can help identify optimal trial sites and recruit suitable patients faster.\n\n**Key Players and Technologies:**\n\n*   **AI-Native Biotech Companies:** Numerous startups (like Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, Atomwise, Insilico Medicine) are built around AI-driven drug discovery platforms.\n*   **Big Pharma Partnerships:** Major pharmaceutical companies are heavily investing in AI, either by building their own capabilities or partnering with AI-biotech firms.\n*   **Advanced Machine Learning Models:** Beyond traditional ML, deep learning, graph neural networks (GNNs), and transformer models are proving particularly powerful for analyzing molecular structures and biological data.\n\n**Challenges and Future Outlook:**\n\nDespite the rapid progress, challenges remain:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Accessibility:** High-quality, standardized biological and chemical data is crucial for training effective AI models.\n*   **Interpretability and Explainability:** Understanding *why* an AI model suggests a particular molecule or target is important for scientific validation and regulatory approval.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still need rigorous experimental validation in labs.\n*   **Regulatory Pathways:** Evolving regulatory frameworks are needed to accommodate AI-designed drugs.\n\nHowever, the overall outlook is incredibly positive. AI is fundamentally changing the speed, cost, and success rate of drug discovery, bringing hope for faster development of new treatments for a wide range of diseases.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps mention some specific examples of AI-discovered drugs that are entering clinical trials?\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned in my previous response about AI in drug discovery. That was:\n\n**2. Enhanced Target Identification and Validation**\n\nLet's dive deeper into what this means and why it's so significant:\n\n**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n\nBefore we go further, it's crucial to understand what a \"drug target\" is. In essence, it's a specific molecule within the body (usually a protein, but sometimes RNA or DNA) that plays a key role in a disease process. For example:\n\n*   In cancer, a target might be a protein that helps a tumor cell grow uncontrollably.\n*   In an infectious disease, a target could be a vital enzyme within a virus or bacterium.\n*   In autoimmune diseases, a target might be a signaling molecule that triggers an overactive immune response.\n\nA drug is designed to interact with this target – often to inhibit its function, activate it, or otherwise alter its behavior – to treat the disease.\n\n**How AI Enhances Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nTraditionally, identifying and validating drug targets has been a slow, laborious, and often serendipitous process involving extensive laboratory experiments, hypothesis testing, and deep biological expertise. AI is revolutionizing this by:\n\n*   **Integrating and Analyzing Multi-Omics Data:**\n    *   **The Challenge:** Modern biological research generates vast amounts of data from different sources:\n        *   **Genomics:** The complete set of genes in an organism.\n        *   **Transcriptomics:** The RNA molecules transcribed from genes (indicating gene activity).\n        *   **Proteomics:** The complete set of proteins.\n        *   **Metabolomics:** The complete set of small molecules (metabolites).\n        *   **Clinical Data:** Patient health records, disease phenotypes, treatment responses.\n    *   **The AI Solution:** AI algorithms, particularly machine learning and deep learning, can sift through these massive, heterogeneous datasets to find subtle patterns and correlations that human researchers might miss.\n        *   **Example:** AI can identify that a specific gene mutation (genomics) leads to an overproduction of a particular protein (proteomics) in diseased cells compared to healthy cells, making that protein a strong candidate target.\n\n*   **Building Sophisticated Biological Models:**\n    *   **Network Biology:** AI can construct complex models of biological pathways and networks. By understanding how different molecules interact, AI can predict which nodes (potential targets) are most critical to perturbing a disease.\n    *   **Disease Subtyping:** AI can analyze patient data to identify distinct subtypes of a disease, each potentially driven by different molecular mechanisms and requiring different targets.\n\n*   **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":**\n    *   **The Problem:** Not all biological targets are suitable for drug development. Some may be difficult to interact with using small molecules or antibodies, or they might be essential for normal bodily functions, making them risky targets.\n    *   **The AI Solution:** AI models are being trained on data from successful and failed drug targets to predict the \"druggability\" of new candidates. They can assess factors like the target's structural characteristics, its role in the disease pathway, and its potential for off-target effects. This helps prioritize targets that are more likely to lead to a successful drug.\n\n*   **Hypothesis Generation and Prioritization:**\n    *   **AI as a Research Assistant:** AI can act as a powerful hypothesis generator. By analyzing scientific literature, patents, and experimental data, it can suggest novel connections between genes, proteins, diseases, and pathways that researchers can then investigate experimentally.\n    *   **Ranking Candidates:** AI can rank potential targets based on their predicted importance in disease, druggability, and potential for innovation, allowing research teams to focus their limited resources on the most promising avenues.\n\n**Why is This Development So Important?**\n\n*   **Speed:** AI significantly accelerates the identification of promising targets, which is often the bottleneck in drug discovery.\n*   **Efficiency:** By focusing on better targets early on, AI reduces the wasted effort and resources spent on developing drugs against poor targets.\n*   **Novelty:** AI can uncover non-obvious targets that might be missed by traditional approaches, leading to truly innovative therapies.\n*   **Precision:** By understanding disease mechanisms at a deeper molecular level, AI can help identify targets for more precise and personalized medicines.\n\nIn essence, AI is turning target identification from an educated guess into a more data-driven, systematic, and predictive process, laying a stronger foundation for successful drug development.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies involved in **AI-driven Target Identification and Validation**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
